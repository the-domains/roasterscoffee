Starting with a simple desire to create a fun coffee experience for the customer Roasters Coffee found a thriving community of people. That community created momentum one cup of coffee at a time and helped Roasters expand its reach. Year after year Roaster began to learn more about serving people, crafting quality products, and provided a fantastic culture. 

It was through multiple years of experimentation and passion that Roasters truly found its identity in the coffee world. What started as a simple desire with a few baristas and a handful of customers has evolved into a massive coffee empire in the heart of Tri-Cities, Wa.

The customer that calls Roasters its coffee shop is truly the energy and love that keeps its doors revolving.
